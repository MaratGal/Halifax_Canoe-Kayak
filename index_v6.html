                    is the capital of the Canadian province of Nova Scotia. 
                    It had a population of 403,131 in 2016, with 316,701 in the urban 
                    area centred on Halifax Harbour. In July 2020 Statistics Canada estimated 
                    the population of the CMA at 448,544. The regional municipality consists of 
                    four former municipalities that were amalgamated in 1996: Halifax, 
                    Dartmouth, Bedford, and Halifax County.

                     Sydney was founded in 1785 by the British, was incorporated as a city in 1904, 
                     and dissolved on 1 August 1995, when it was amalgamated into the regional 
                     municipality. Sydney is located in Mikmaki, the ancestral and unceded territory 
                     of the Mikmaq People. This territory is covered by the “Treaties of Peace and Friendship”
